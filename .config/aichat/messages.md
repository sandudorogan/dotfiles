# CHAT: what are the functions provided by default and how can I add them to the models? [2025-03-10T13:02:20+02:00] (#aichat-wiki)
what are the functions provided by default and how can I add them to the models?
--------
The provided context does not specify which functions are included by default or how to add them to the models. However, based on the information given, here's what you can infer:

1. **Default Functions:**
   The document does not explicitly list the default functions. It mentions that the functions are listed in the `<aichat-config-dir>/functions/functions.json` file. To find out which functions are available by default, you would need to check this file.

2. **Adding Functions to Models:**
   To add or modify functions, you can use the `.edit config` command in the AIChat REPL to modify the configuration file. Additionally, the document mentions that you can configure the `use_tools` option in the configuration file to specify which tools should be used by default:
   ```
   use_tools: <tool-group-or-individual-tools>
   ```
   You can also group tools using the `mapping_tools` option:
   ```
   mapping_tools:
     fs: 'fs_cat,fs_ls,fs_mkdir,fs_rm,fs_write'
   ```

For more detailed instructions on setting up and using functions, you may need to refer to the `llm-functions` GitHub repository or the specific documentation provided in the context:
```
# Visit https://github.com/sigoden/llm-functions for setup instructions
```

If you need to add a specific function, you would typically add the function's identifier to the `use_tools` configuration or its group in `mapping_tools`. If the function is not included by default, you might need to install or define it according to the setup instructions provided in the `llm-functions` repository or other documentation.

I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to current weather conditions. However, I can give you general information about the temperature in Bucharest, Romania.

Bucharest has a temperate continental climate with cold winters and warm summers. The average temperature varies throughout the year:

- Winter (December to February): around 0¬∞C to 5¬∞C (32¬∞F to 41¬∞F)
- Spring (March to May): around 10¬∞C to 20¬∞C (50¬∞F to 68¬∞F)
- Summer (June to August): around 22¬∞C to 30¬∞C (72¬∞F to 86¬∞F)
- Autumn (September to November): around 10¬∞C to 20¬∞C (50¬∞F to 68¬∞F)

For the most recent and accurate temperature information, I recommend checking a weather forecast website or app, such as AccuWeather, Weather.com, or a local Romanian weather service.

get last column in output in bash?
--------
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how to get the last column from a command's output in bash. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that in bash, when you run a command, the output is usually displayed in rows and columns. For example, when I run the `ls -l` command, it lists files in a detailed format with columns like permissions, owner, size, and filename.

So, if I want to extract the last column, which in the case of `ls -l` is the filename, I need a way to process each line and pick the last field. I remember that the `awk` command is useful for processing text files and outputting specific columns. By default, `awk` splits each line into fields based on whitespace, so that should work here.

I think the basic syntax would be something like `awk '{print $NF}'`, where `$NF` is a built-in variable in `awk` that represents the last field. So, if I pipe the output of `ls -l` to this `awk` command, it should print the last column.

Wait, but what if the output has fields with spaces, like filenames with spaces? In that case, using `awk` might not work correctly because it splits on any whitespace. Maybe I should consider using `cut` instead, but `cut` requires knowing the delimiter and the number of fields, which might not be straightforward if the number of columns isn't fixed.

Alternatively, I could use `tail` command, but `tail` is for viewing the end of a file, not for columns. So that might not be the right approach.

Another thought: using `rev` to reverse the output and then `cut` to remove everything after the first field, then reverse it back. For example, `ls -l | rev | cut -d' ' -f1 | rev`. This way, it doesn't matter how many columns there are; it just takes the last one. But I'm not sure if this is efficient or reliable, especially if the output has varying numbers of spaces between columns.

Going back to `awk`, I think it's the most straightforward method. I'll test it with `ls -l | awk '{print $NF}'` and see if it correctly outputs the filenames. If filenames have spaces, this should still work because `awk` treats consecutive whitespace as a single delimiter by default.

Wait, no, actually, if a filename has spaces, the `ls -l` command will display it as a single field because the filename is a single argument, but when `ls` outputs it, it's just a string with spaces. So, in the output, the filename is still the last field, and `awk` should correctly identify it as the last field regardless of internal spaces.

So, the command `ls -l | awk '{print $NF}'` should work. I can also test this with another command, like `echo -e "a b c\nd e f g" | awk '{print $NF}'` to see if it correctly outputs 'c' and 'g'.

Yes, that seems to work. So, the solution is to pipe the output to `awk` and print the last field using `$NF`.
</think>

To get the last column in the output of a command in bash, you can use the `awk` command. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Use the `awk` Command**: Pipe the output of your command to `awk` and use the `$NF` variable, which represents the last field in each line.

   ```bash
   your_command | awk '{print $NF}'
   ```

   - **Example**: To get the filenames from `ls -l`:

     ```bash
     ls -l | awk '{print $NF}'
     ```

   This will output the last column of each line from the command's output.

**Answer:** You can get the last column using `awk '{print $NF}'`. For example, `ls -l | awk '{print $NF}'` will display the last column of the output.

# CHAT: get last column in output in bash? [2025-03-10T13:38:52+02:00]
get last column in output in bash?
--------
To get the last column in the output of a command in bash, you can use the `awk` command. Here's an example:

```bash
your_command | awk '{print $NF}'
```

In this command, `$NF` is a special variable in `awk` that refers to the last field in the current record. 

Here's how it works:

1. `your_command` is the command that produces the output you want to parse.
2. The pipe `|` redirects the output of `your_command` to the `awk` command.
3. `awk '{print $NF}'` prints only the last column of the output.

Here is an example use case:

```bash
echo "1 2 3" | awk '{print $NF}'
# prints: 3
```

Alternatively, you can use `cut` command as well:

```bash
your_command | cut -d ' ' -f $(your_command | head -n 1 | wc -w)
```

However, `cut` has some limitations and may not work as expected for outputs with inconsistent column delimiters. The `awk` solution is generally safer.

If the delimiter is not spaces, replace `' '` with the actual delimiter.

Note: This will consider spaces as delimiter, you may need to adjust the command as per your actual delimiter.

Example with multiple lines:
```bash
echo -e "1 2 3\n4 5 6"
1 2 3
4 5 6

echo -e "1 2 3\n4 5 6" | awk '{print $NF}'
3
6
```

<think>
Alright, the user is asking how to get the last column in the output using bash. I remember that in bash, the `awk` command is really useful for handling columns. So, I should suggest using `awk '{print $NF}'` because `$NF` represents the last field by default. 

But wait, maybe the user doesn't know what `NF` stands for. I should explain that `NF` is a built-in variable in awk that holds the number of fields in the current record. That way, they understand why it works for getting the last column.

I should also provide an example to make it clearer. Using `ls -l` as an example makes sense because it's a common command with multiple columns. So, piping `ls -l` to `awk '{print $NF}'` will print the last column, which in this case is the filenames.

Additionally, I should mention how to use this command in a pipeline. Maybe the user wants to use it in a script or another command. So, I can show how to capture the output into a variable using `last_column=$(command | awk '{print $NF}')`.

I should also consider if there are alternative methods, just in case `awk` isn't preferred. For instance, using `cut` with `-f` and a large number might not be reliable if the number of columns varies. But `awk` seems the most straightforward and reliable here.

Oh, and I should note that the default field separator in `awk` is whitespace, which works for most cases. If the output has different separators, the user might need to adjust the `FS` variable, but that's probably beyond the basic use case they're asking for.

I think that's a solid explanation. It covers the main solution, explains the components, provides an example, and touches on usage in a broader context. This should help the user understand and apply the command effectively.
</think>

To get the last column in the output using bash, you can use the `awk` command:

```bash
awk '{print $NF}'
```

Here, `$NF` represents the last field (column) of the input. By default, `awk` uses whitespace as the field separator.

### Example usage:
If you have output like:

```bash
ls -l | awk '{print $NF}'
```

This will print the filenames (last column) from the `ls -l` command.

You can also use it in a pipeline to capture the last column of any command's output.

# CHAT: how can i link python with python3 in brew? [2025-03-10T14:08:14+02:00]
how can i link python with python3 in brew?
--------
<think>
Alright, the user is asking how to link Python with Python3 using Brew. I remember that Brew is a package manager for macOS, and it's commonly used to install and manage software. 

First, I should figure out if there's a specific formula or package that handles Python 3. I recall that Brew has a 'python' package which usually points to Python 3, but sometimes there might be a separate one. 

I think the correct approach is to install the 'python' package because that should set up Python 3. Then, after installation, the user can verify by checking the versions of 'python' and 'python3' in the terminal. 

I should also consider if there are any existing Python installations that might cause conflicts. Maybe suggesting to uninstall any previous versions could help avoid issues. 

So, the steps would be: install the python package, check the versions, and if needed, remove any conflicting installations. That should link Python to Python3 correctly through Brew.

</think>

To link Python with Python 3 using Homebrew, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Python 3 using Homebrew**:
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```
   This will install Python 3, as the `python` formula in Homebrew typically points to Python 3.

2. **Verify the Installation**:
   After installation, check the versions to ensure Python 3 is installed correctly:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   You should see something like `Python 3.x.y`.

3. **Link Python to Python 3 (if necessary)**:
   If you need to link `python` to `python3`, you can create a symbolic link. Run:
   ```bash
   brew link --overwrite python
   ```

4. **Check the Link**:
   Verify that `python` points to Python 3:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   This should now show Python 3's version.

By following these steps, you ensure that Python 3 is properly installed and linked using Homebrew.

--------
<think>
Okay, so the user is trying to fix a Homebrew linking issue with Python. They ran `brew link --overwrite python` and got a warning that Python 3.13 is already linked. The system suggested running `brew unlink python@3.13 && brew link python@3.13` to relink it.

First, I should understand what's happening. Homebrew manages packages, and sometimes links can become broken or outdated. The user wants to ensure Python is properly linked.

The warning message indicates that Python 3.13 is already linked, so forcing the link might not be necessary. But the user might be encountering issues that they think relinking would solve.

I should guide them through the suggested steps. First, unlink the current Python 3.13 installation. Then, relink it. This can sometimes resolve issues where the system isn't recognizing the correct Python version or where dependencies are mismanaged.

I need to present the commands clearly. I'll write them out step by step so the user can follow along easily. It's also good to explain what each command does to help them understand the process.

After they run these commands, they should verify that Python is correctly linked. Suggesting they check the version with `python3 --version` would be a good way to confirm everything worked.

I should also consider if there might be other issues, but since the user's message is specific to linking, focusing on that is best. If they have more problems, they can ask further.

So, I'll outline the steps clearly, provide the commands, and suggest a verification method. That should help the user resolve their linking issue effectively.

</think>

To fix the linking issue with Python in Homebrew, follow these steps:

1. **Unlink the current Python installation**:
   ```bash
   brew unlink python@3.13
   ```

2. **Relink the Python installation**:
   ```bash
   brew link python@3.13
   ```

After running these commands, you should no longer encounter the linking warning. If you need to verify that Python is properly linked, you can check the version with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

--------
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to fix a Python linking issue on their macOS system using Homebrew. They ran the command `brew link --overwrite python`, but it didn't work as expected. The system is still pointing to Python 3.13.2, and they want to ensure that the `python` command points to `python3`.

First, I need to understand why the linking isn't working. Homebrew might be linking a specific version of Python, and simply relinking might not change the default. The user wants `python` to point to `python3`, which is typically the desired behavior in many development environments.

I recall that Homebrew has a `link` command that can force overwrite existing links, but sometimes it's necessary to unlink the current version first. The user tried `brew link --overwrite python`, but it didn't change the default. So, the next step is to unlink the existing Python version and then relink it.

I should suggest them to first unlink Python 3.13 using `brew unlink python@3.13` and then relink it with `brew link --overwrite python@3.13`. This should reset the linking and ensure that `python` points to `python3`.

Additionally, after relinking, it's a good idea to verify the version by running `python --version` to confirm that it's pointing to the correct version. If that doesn't work, checking the `PATH` environment variable might help identify any issues with the executable paths.

I should also consider if there are other Python versions installed that might interfere. Using `brew list` can show all installed Python versions, and using `which -a python` can display all executables in the path, helping to pinpoint any conflicts.

Overall, the solution involves unlinking and relinking the correct Python version through Homebrew, verifying the changes, and ensuring the environment variables are correctly set.

</think>

To resolve the Python linking issue and ensure `python` points to `python3`, follow these steps:

1. **Unlink the current Python version:**
   ```bash
   brew unlink python@3.13
   ```

2. **Relink Python with overwrite:**
   ```bash
   brew link --overwrite python@3.13
   ```

3. **Verify the Python version:**
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

If the issue persists, check your `PATH` environment variable and ensure that `/opt/homebrew/bin` is correctly set. You might also verify all installed Python versions using `brew list` and check the executable paths with `which -a python`.

This should set `python` to point to `python3` as desired.

hot to get the latest column in bash?
--------
```bash
awk '{print $NF}'
```

This command uses `awk` to print the last field (`$NF`) of each line.  `NF` is a built-in variable in `awk` that represents the number of fields in the current record (line, by default).  This is generally the most robust and simplest way to get the last column, as it correctly handles lines with varying numbers of columns and different delimiters.

Here are a few other ways, along with explanations of when they might be preferred or avoided:

**1. Using `cut` (Less Robust):**

```bash
cut -d ' ' -f $(wc -w | awk '{print $1}')
```
This approach using `cut` has some problems.

*   **Delimiter Specificity:**  The `-d ' '` specifies a single space as the delimiter.  This *fails* if there are multiple spaces between columns, or if the delimiter is a tab or other character.  You would need to change the delimiter appropriately.  `awk '{print $NF}'` by contrast handles multiple spaces/tabs by default and works no matter what whitespace is used.
* `wc -w` counts words using whitespace, however, if the last element contains any spaces, it will miscalculate the total number of columns.

**2. Using `rev` (Only for single-character delimiters, and not robust if columns can contain newlines):**

```bash
rev | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | rev
```
This reverses each line, cuts the first field, and then reverses the result back. This only works if the delimiter is a *single* character. It also won't work reliably if any of the column contents themselves could include newlines.

**3.  Bash Parameter Expansion (Only if the data is already in a variable and fields do not contain spaces):**

```bash
data="col1 col2 col3"
IFS=' ' read -ra columns <<< "$data"
echo "${columns[-1]}"
```
This approach is useful if you already have the data in a shell variable and want to avoid external commands.  `IFS=' '` sets the input field separator to a space, `read -ra columns` reads the data into an array named `columns`, and `${columns[-1]}` accesses the last element of the array. It is not robust for space-containing columns.

**4. Using `sed` (Overly Complex for this Task):**

```bash
sed 's/.* //'  # or sed 's/.*\s//' for any whitespace
```

While `sed` *can* do this, it's unnecessarily complex. The regular expression `s/.* //` replaces everything up to the last space (and the space itself) with nothing, effectively leaving only the last column.

**In summary, the `awk '{print $NF}'` approach is the most generally applicable, robust, and efficient solution for getting the last column in Bash.** It correctly handles variable numbers of columns and is not sensitive to the specific delimiter used, as long as it's whitespace. The other solutions are only useful in specific, limited situations, and are generally more error-prone.

The error occurs because you're specifying two network modes at the same time: `--network=host` (a non-user-defined network) and `--network=crossbeam-unified` (a user-defined network). Docker only allows a single network mode for a container.

To fix the error, choose one network mode:

- **Use host networking:** Remove the `--network=crossbeam-unified` flag.
  
  ```bash
  docker run -i --network=host --rm --init -e DOCKER_CONTAINER=true mcp/puppeteer
  ```

- **Use the user-defined network:** Remove the `--network=host` flag.

recursive fibonacci in bash
--------
<tool_calls>
<think>
Alright, so the user is asking about implementing a recursive Fibonacci sequence in Bash. Let me break down how I approached this.

First, I need to recall what a Fibonacci sequence is. It's a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and so on.

Next, I think about how to implement this recursively in Bash. Bash is a shell scripting language, so I know it's possible to write functions, but recursion might be a bit tricky because of how Bash handles function calls and variables.

I start by considering a function that takes a number 'n' and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The base cases are when n is 0 or 1, where the function should return 0 and 1 respectively. For other values of n, the function should call itself with n-1 and n-2 and sum the results.

Now, I need to write this function in Bash. I remember that in Bash, functions are defined using the 'function' keyword, and variables are passed as arguments. So, I draft a function called 'fib' that takes one argument, 'n'.

I also need to handle the base cases first. If n is 0, return 0. If n is 1, return 1. For n greater than 1, recursively call fib with n-1 and n-2.

Once the function is written, I should test it. I decide to create an array to store the sequence up to the 10th number for clarity. Using a loop from 0 to 9, I call fib(i) and store each result in the array.

Finally, I print the array to display the sequence.

I make sure to explain each step clearly so the user can follow along, from defining the function to testing it with a loop and outputting the results.

</think>

To implement a recursive Fibonacci sequence in Bash, we can create a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

fib() {
    if [ $1 -eq 0 ]; then
        echo 0
    elif [ $1 -eq 1 ]; then
        echo 1
    else
        echo $(($(fib $(($1-1))) + $(fib $(($1-2)))))
    fi
}

# Example usage: Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib_sequence=()
for i in {0..9}; do
    fib_sequence+=($(fib $i))
done

echo "Fibonacci sequence (first 10 numbers): ${fib_sequence[@]}"
```

This script defines a recursive function `fib` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. It then generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers and prints them out.

</tool_calls>
<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about implementing the Fibonacci sequence in Bash. They mentioned "recursive fibonacci in bash," which tells me they want a Bash script that calculates Fibonacci numbers using recursion. 

First, I remember that the Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and so on. 

Since they want a recursive approach, I need to think about how recursion works. In recursion, a function calls itself with a modified argument until it reaches a base case. For Fibonacci, the base cases are typically when n is 0 or 1, returning 0 and 1 respectively. For any other n, the function should return the sum of Fibonacci(n-1) and Fibonacci(n-2).

Now, considering Bash scripting, I know that functions can be defined, and they can call themselves. So, I'll start by writing a function called test_fib that takes an integer as an argument. 

The function will have conditional checks: if the input is 0, return 0; if it's 1, return 1. For any other number, it will recursively call itself with n-1 and n-2, then add the results together.

I should also include a shebang line at the top to specify that this is a Bash script. Then, after defining the function, I'll add a line to test it by echoing the result of Fibonacci(5), which should be 5.

I need to make sure the syntax is correct for Bash. Using square brackets for conditionals and proper string interpolation with $( ) for command substitution. Also, the function should be called correctly with the argument passed in.

I think about potential issues, like the recursion depth. Bash has a limit on recursion depth to prevent stack overflows, so for larger numbers, this script might not work and could cause errors. But since the user didn't specify a large n, I assume it's for small values.

Finally, I'll format the code neatly, making sure it's easy to read and includes comments if necessary, but since the code is straightforward, comments might not be needed.

So, putting it all together, I write the script with the function and the test case, ensuring that it outputs the correct Fibonacci number when executed.

</think>

Here is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

test_fib() {
    if [ $1 -eq 0 ]; then
        echo 0
    elif [ $1 -eq 1 ]; then
        echo 1
    else
        echo $(($(test_fib $(($1-1))) + $(test_fib $(($1-2)))))
    fi
}

echo "Fibonacci(5): $(test_fib 5)"
```

When executed, this script will output:

```
Fibonacci(5): 5
```

This script calculates the Fibonacci number recursively. The function `test_fib` takes an integer as input and returns the Fibonacci number for that position in the sequence. The recursion continues until it reaches the base cases (0 or 1), at which point it starts returning values back up the call stack.

You can modify the number `5` in the `echo` statement to calculate different Fibonacci numbers.

Now, let's make the script executable:
--------

# CHAT: recursive fibonacci in bash [2025-04-03T11:00:00+03:00]
recursive fibonacci in bash
--------
Below is one way to implement a recursive Fibonacci function in a Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number
fib() {
    if [ "$1" -lt 2 ]; then
        echo "$1"
    else
        local a b
        a=$(fib $(( $1 - 1 )))
        b=$(fib $(( $1 - 2 )))
        echo $(( a + b ))
    fi
}

# Check for an input argument
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <number>"
    exit 1
fi

# Calculate and display the Fibonacci number
result=$(fib "$1")
echo "Fibonacci($1) = $result"
```

### How It Works
- **Function Definition:**  
  The `fib()` function checks if its argument is less than 2 (i.e., 0 or 1), and if so, it returns that value. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to get the two preceding Fibonacci numbers and sums them.

- **Input Check:**  
  The script expects one command-line argument. If it isn't provided, it outputs a usage message.

- **Result Display:**  
  The final result is stored in `result` and then printed.

> **Note:** Recursive Fibonacci is mainly for educational purposes due to its exponential time complexity. For large inputs, consider iterative solutions or other more efficient methods.

  fi
}
```
You can use it like this: `fibonacci 10` to calculate the 10th Fibonacci number.

Note: This recursive implementation is not efficient for large values of n, as it performs many redundant calculations. For large values, an iterative solution or a solution using dynamic programming would be more efficient.

# CHAT: recursive fibonacci in bash with dynamic programming [2025-04-03T11:05:14+03:00]
recursive fibonacci in bash with dynamic programming
--------
Below is an example of a recursive Fibonacci function in Bash that uses dynamic programming (memoization) to cache computed Fibonacci values. This script uses an associative array (available in Bash version 4 and above) to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Declare an associative array for memoization
declare -A fib_cache

# Recursive Fibonacci function using memoization
fib() {
    local n=$1

    # Check if the value is already computed
    if [[ -n "${fib_cache[$n]}" ]]; then
        echo "${fib_cache[$n]}"
        return
    fi

    # Base cases
    if (( n <= 0 )); then
        fib_cache[$n]=0
        echo 0
    elif (( n == 1 )); then
        fib_cache[$n]=1
        echo 1
    else
        # Recursive computation with memoization
        local n1=$(fib $(( n - 1 )))
        local n2=$(fib $(( n - 2 )))
        local result=$(( n1 + n2 ))
        fib_cache[$n]=$result
        echo $result
    fi
}

# Check if an argument is provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <n>"
    exit 1
fi

# Compute and display the nth Fibonacci number
result=$(fib "$1")
echo "Fibonacci($1) = $result"
```

### How It Works

1. **Associative Array Initialization**:  
   The script starts by declaring the associative array `fib_cache` which will store the computed Fibonacci numbers.

2. **Base Cases**:  
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it returns 0.
   - If `n` is 1, it returns 1.
   
3. **Recursion and Memoization**:  
   - Before computing `fib(n)`, the function checks if the value is already in the cache. If it is, the cached value is returned directly.
   - Otherwise, it recursively computes `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)`, adds them together, stores the result in the cache, and then returns it.

4. **Usage**:  
   The script expects a single argument which is the position (n) of the Fibonacci sequence to calculate.

### Running the Script

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `fib.sh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x fib.sh
   ```
3. Run the script with a number as an argument:
   ```bash
   ./fib.sh 10
   ```
   This will output:
   ```
   Fibonacci(10) = 55
   ```

This script efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers even for moderately high values of `n` thanks to the use of memoization.

</tool_calls>
I've modified the `fibonacci.sh` script to use dynamic programming instead of the recursive approach. Here's what I changed:

1. Replaced the inefficient recursive implementation with a dynamic programming approach using an array to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.

2. The new implementation:
   - Still handles the base cases (0 and 1) directly
   - Uses a bottom-up approach by storing each calculated Fibonacci number in an array
   - Iteratively builds up the sequence to the desired position
   - Eliminates redundant calculations, making it much more efficient

3. Added input validation to ensure the user provides a non-negative integer.

This dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(n) compared to the original recursive approach which had O(2^n). The new implementation will be much faster for larger values of n and avoids the stack overflow issues that can occur with recursive approaches.

You can run the script using:
```
./fibonacci.sh 10
```

This will calculate the 10th Fibonacci number efficiently using the dynamic programming approach.

how can i create a macro using a specific model in mind?
--------
To create a macro using a specific model in mind, you can define a YAML file for the macro in the `<aichat-config-dir>/macros/` directory. The filename (excluding the `.yaml` extension) will serve as the macro's name. 

In the YAML file, you need to specify the `steps` section, which is an array of strings representing REPL commands to be executed in sequence. You can use the `.model` command to switch to your desired model. 

Here's an example of a macro that uses a specific model:

```
steps:
  - .model openai:gpt-4o
  - .agent
  - your_input
```

Replace `openai:gpt-4o` with your desired model and `your_input` with the input you want to provide to the model. 

You can also define variables in the `variables` section to make your macro more flexible. For example:

```
variables:
  - name: model
    default: openai:gpt-4o
  - name: input
steps:
  - .model {{model}}
  - .agent
  - {{input}}
```

In this case, you can execute the macro with the `.macro` command and provide the model and input as arguments. 

Please note that the above information is based on the context provided and might not be accurate or up-to-date. If you need more specific or detailed information, I recommend checking the official documentation of AIChat or seeking help from the AIChat community.

2. `within-agent.yaml`: This macro allows you to interact with an agent and provides a variable `args` to pass arguments to the agent.

```
variables:
  - name: agent
  - name: args
    rest: true
    default: What can your do?
steps:
  - .agent {{agent}}
  - '{{args}}'
```

3. `multi-agents.yaml`: This macro demonstrates how to interact with multiple agents in a single macro.

```
variables:
  - name: args
    rest: true
steps:
  - .agent design-tui
  - '{{args}}'
  - .agent build-tui
  - .file %%
  - .agent fixing-bugs
  - .file %%
```

As for additional examples, here are a few ideas:

* A macro to translate text from one language to another using the `.file` command with a translation service.
* A macro to summarize a long piece of text using a summarization tool.
* A macro to generate code based on a prompt using a code generation model.
* A macro to create a new role or session with specific settings.
* A macro to automate a series of commands for a specific task, such as data analysis or content creation.

# CHAT: can you enhance the commit message macro to ask the user whether they like it... [2025-04-03T11:25:08+03:00] (#aichat-wiki)
can you enhance the commit message macro to ask the user whether they like it and if they do commit the changes with the generated message?
--------
I can try to help you with enhancing the commit message macro. To confirm, you want the macro to do the following:

1. Generate a commit message
2. Ask the user if they like the generated message
3. If the user likes the message, commit the changes with the generated message

Here is an example of how you could define this macro in a YAML file:
```
steps:
  - .file `git diff` -- generate git commit message
  - .prompt "Do you like the generated commit message? (yes/no)"
  - .if yes
    - .execute git commit -m "{{generated_message}}"
  - .else
    - .prompt "Please enter a new commit message"
    - .execute git commit -m "{{new_message}}"
```
This macro uses the `.file` command to generate a commit message based on the `git diff` output. It then prompts the user to confirm if they like the generated message. If the user responds with "yes", it commits the changes with the generated message. If the user responds with "no", it prompts them to enter a new commit message and commits the changes with the new message.

Please note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, this macro assumes that you have the `git` command installed and configured on your system.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!

if the user presses enter, without writing anything, will the prompt select yes automatically?
--------
The provided context does not directly answer the question "if the user presses enter, without writing anything, will the prompt select yes automatically?" However, based on the information given about AIChat's features and configurations, it seems that this question pertains to how prompts are handled within the system, particularly in relation to roles and their configurations.

In the context of AIChat, roles are defined with specific prompts that guide the Large Language Model's (LLM) behavior. There are types of prompts, including embedded prompts that contain placeholders for user input, system prompts that set a general context, and few-shot prompts that provide more detailed instructions with examples of input and output.

The syntax for prompts includes variables and conditional statements, such as `{?var <template>}` and `{!var <template>}`, which allow for dynamic generation of prompts based on conditions. However, the specific behavior of a prompt when a user presses enter without typing anything isn't explicitly addressed in the provided context.

Given the context's focus on customizing LLM behaviors through roles, sessions, and RAG (Retrieve, Augment, Generate), and the absence of a direct reference to the automatic selection of "yes" when a user presses enter without input, it seems this question might relate to a specific role or prompt configuration not detailed in the provided information.

Therefore, without more specific details about the role or prompt configuration in question, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. The behavior of automatically selecting "yes" when a user presses enter without writing anything would likely depend on the specific prompt template and the variables or conditions defined within it.

# FZF Command for File Selection with Line Numbers

I've created a shell script called `fzf_files.sh` that fulfills your requirements. This script:

1. Checks if the current directory is in a git repository
2. If it's in a git repo, it gets all tracked files using `git ls-files`
3. Otherwise, it finds all common text files recursively (various extensions like .txt, .md, .py, etc.)
4. Uses fzf with file preview (showing line numbers) to let you select files
5. For each selected file, adds the file path and content with line numbers to files.md

Here's the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the current directory is in a git repository
if git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  # If in a git repo, get all tracked files
  FILES_COMMAND="git ls-files"
else
  # Otherwise, find all text files recursively
  FILES_COMMAND="find . -type f -name \"*.txt\" -o -name \"*.md\" -o -name \"*.json\" -o -name \"*.csv\" -o -name \"*.py\" -o -name \"*.js\" -o -name \"*.html\" -o -name \"*.css\" -o -name \"*.sh\" -o -name \"*.c\" -o -name \"*.cpp\" -o -name \"*.h\" -o -name \"*.java\" -o -name \"*.rb\""
fi

# Use the appropriate command to get files, pipe them through fzf 
# The preview shows file content with line numbers
# Selected files are processed to include filepath and line numbers in files.md
eval "$FILES_COMMAND" | fzf --multi --preview "bat --style=numbers --color=always {}" | while read -r file; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "# $file" >> files.md
    nl -ba "$file" | sed "s/^/    /" >> files.md
    echo "" >> files.md
  fi
done
```

## How to use:

1. Save this script to a file named `fzf_files.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x fzf_files.sh`
3. Run it: `./fzf_files.sh`
4. In the fzf interface, you can:
   - Use arrow keys to navigate
   - Press Tab to select multiple files
   - Press Enter to confirm selection
   - Use / to search within the file list

The script will create or append to a file named `files.md` with your selected files, including file paths and line-numbered content.

Note: This script requires fzf, git (for git repos), and the bat command (for preview with syntax highlighting) to be installed on your system.

</tool_calls>
I've created a shell command that builds a filter using fzf to list files and their line numbers in a files.md file. The command is intelligent enough to detect whether it's in a git repository or not:

```bash
if git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree &>/dev/null; then
  # In git repo - use git-tracked files
  git ls-files | fzf --preview 'bat --style=numbers --color=always {}' | xargs -I{} bash -c 'echo "## {}" >> files.md && nl -ba "{}" | sed "s/^/    /" >> files.md && echo "" >> files.md'
else
  # Not in git repo - find text files
  find . -type f -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.html" -o -name "*.css" -o -name "*.json" | fzf --preview 'bat --style=numbers --color=always {}' | xargs -I{} bash -c 'echo "## {}" >> files.md && nl -ba "{}" | sed "s/^/    /" >> files.md && echo "" >> files.md'
fi
```

This command:

1. Checks if the current directory is in a git repository
2. If in a git repo, it lists all tracked files using `git ls-files`
3. If not in a git repo, it finds all common text files (txt, md, js, py, etc.)
4. Uses fzf for interactive file selection with a preview window showing the file with line numbers
5. For each selected file:
   - Adds a markdown heading with the file path to files.md
   - Adds the file content with line numbers, properly indented
   - Adds a blank line for readability

The files.md document has been initialized with a simple header. When you run the command, you'll be able to interactively select files with fzf, and their contents will be added to the files.md file with proper formatting.

To count the number of tokens in a file, I need to understand what kind of tokens you're referring to. "Tokens" can mean different things in different contexts:

1. Words or linguistic elements in a text file
2. Programming language tokens (like keywords, identifiers, operators)
3. Authentication tokens or other specific formats

Let me help you count tokens in a file based on what you need. Could you please:
1. Specify what kind of tokens you want to count
2. Provide the path to the file you want to analyze

You haven't provided a specific codebase for me to analyze.

However, if you are referring to the set of tools and functions available to *me* (which were listed in the initial prompt), then this "codebase" defines a collection of capabilities that allow me to interact with various systems and information sources.

Specifically, this set of tools allows me to:

1.  **Access Information:**
    *   Get current weather (`get_current_weather`).
    *   Search the web (`web_search`).
    *   Fetch content from URLs (`fetch_url_via_curl`).
2.  **Interact with a File System:**
    *   Read files (`fs_cat`).
    *   List files and directories (`fs_ls`).
    *   Create directories (`fs_mkdir`).
    *   Remove files or directories (`fs_rm`).
    *   Write to files (`fs_write`).
3.  **Execute Code and Commands:**
    *   Run shell commands (`execute_command`).
    *   Run Javascript code (`execute_js_code`).
    *   Run Python code (`execute_py_code`).
    *   Run SQL code (`execute_sql_code`).

In essence, this "codebase" equips me, the AI model, with the ability to perform actions beyond just generating text, such as retrieving real-time data, managing files, and running code in different environments to fulfill user requests.

Okay, I can see the files in the current directory. It looks like a Clojure project, given the presence of `deps.edn` and `build.clj`, along with `src` and `test` directories. There are also files related to Docker (`docker`, `docker-compose.yml`) and Kubernetes (`kubernetes`), suggesting it involves containerization and deployment.

To understand what the codebase *specifically* does, the `README.md` file is usually the best place to start.

how can i eat freshly harvested magic mushrooms?
--------
<tool_calls>
<think>
Okay, the user is asking about eating freshly harvested magic mushrooms. I need to figure out what they're needing. Magic mushrooms contain psilocybin, which is psychoactive. The question is about consumption. 

First, maybe they want to know the safest way to consume them. Common methods include drying them, cooking, making tea, or eating raw. But I should ensure that they're following safety guidelines.

Wait, is there specific preparation required? Maybe the user harvested the mushrooms but doesn't know how to process them. Drying is often recommended because eating them fresh might require larger quantities. 

Also, checking if there's any legal consideration here. In many places, magic mushrooms are illegal. Should I mention that?

But the user's question is specifically about how to eat them, so focus on the method. However, it's crucial to inform them about potential legal issues and safety precautions. 

They might be looking for instructions to dry the mushrooms, cook with them, or use in a tea. Maybe the best approach is to explain the typical steps and also advise doing thorough research.

Wait, but the functions available include web_search. Maybe I should suggest a search to find trusted sources. Alternatively, perhaps there's a need to warn against possible mistakes.

Hmm, the tools given include execute_command, but that might not be relevant here. Web_search might be better to get up-to-date information on safe consumption practices.

I need to balance providing information without encouraging illegal activities. Maybe I can outline the general steps and also refer them to reliable resources via a web search function call.

So the steps could include drying the mushrooms first (which enhances the effects), possibly cooking to avoid stomach irritation. Also, dosage is important because fresh mushrooms have higher water content.

Alternatively, the user might want to make a tea by steeping them. Each method has its way of preparing. The answer should also caution about health risks and legality.

Therefore, I should probably use the web_search function to get the most accurate and current guidelines to provide them with reliable information. Let me call the web search function with a query about safe consumption methods and precautions.

</think>


[{"call":{"name":"web_search","arguments":{"query":"how to safely eat freshly harvested magic mushrooms dosage preparation and legal considerations"},"id":"call_1fzg"},"output":{"output":"Legally, check local laws before consuming magic mushrooms. Start with a low dose, around 1-2 grams dried, to gauge effects. Use citrus or chocolate to mask bitterness.\n"}}]
</tool_calls>
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user asked how to eat freshly harvested magic mushrooms. The assistant first used a web_search tool to get information. The response from the tool mentioned legal considerations, starting with a low dose, and using citrus or chocolate to mask bitterness. 

Now the user hasn't provided a new query yet. Wait, actually, the last message was the tool response. The user's original question was about consuming fresh magic mushrooms. The assistant's job is to process the tool's answer and present it to the user. But in the history, after the tool call, the tool response came in, and now the assistant needs to generate a response.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the conversation flow again. Let me go through the messages step by step.

The user's initial question was "how can i eat freshly harvested magic mushrooms?" The assistant then made a tool call to web_search with the query about dosage, preparation, and legal aspects. The tool response provided some info: check local laws, start with 1-2 grams dried, use citrus/chocolate for taste.

Now, the assistant needs to present this information to the user in a helpful way. Since the tool's output is already giving the key points, the assistant should format that into a coherent answer. However, I need to make sure that the answer is clear, structured, and adheres to any guidelines‚Äîlike emphasizing legality first, as that's crucial.

The assistant should probably list the steps or considerations in an organized manner. Points would include:

1. **Legal Check**: Stress the importance of verifying local laws because psilocybin is illegal in many places.
2. **Dosage Guidance**: Mention starting with a low dose (1-2g dried), but note that fresh mushrooms have less potency, so possibly needing more by weight. Wait, the tool response says 1-2 grams dried, but since the user asked about freshly harvested, maybe the assistant should adjust for fresh vs dry? The tool's answer says "around 1-2 grams dried," so perhaps the user needs to convert that to fresh. Since fresh mushrooms are about 90% water, the active compounds are less concentrated, so the actual fresh weight would require more. But maybe that's too detailed, or maybe the tool response already covers that?

3. **Preparation Tips**: Using citrus or chocolate to mask bitterness. Maybe suggest ways to prepare them, like crumbling, adding to food, or using lemon juice. 

Also, include general safety advice: set and setting, supervision, etc.

The assistant should make sure not to encourage illegal activities but present the info responsibly, emphasizing legality first. Also, check if there's any missing info in the tool response. The tool's output is the basis, so the answer should be based on that, but perhaps expanded slightly.

Another thing: the dosage in the tool's response is for dried mushrooms, but the user is asking about freshly harvested. The assistant might need to note that the dosage in fresh mushrooms would be higher. For example, converting 1-2g dried to fresh, since fresh mushrooms might be 10x more in weight due to water. So maybe 10-20 grams fresh? But the tool didn't mention that. Should the assistant add that? Since the tool's response didn't, maybe better to stick to their info but point out that fresh vs dried dosage differs. However, without explicit info from the tool, maybe the assistant should mention that the user needs to adjust for freshness, but since the tool didn't provide exact numbers, maybe just refer to the given 1-2g dried as a starting point, advising to research further on dosage conversion if using fresh.

Also, preparation methods: maybe mention ways to consume them, like eating them directly, cooking, or adding to food. Maybe mention drying them first for easier consumption or more accurate dosing.

Potential safety warnings: Possible adverse effects, psychological preparedness, etc.

So putting it all together, the response should list the steps clearly, prioritize legal info, then dosage, preparation, and safety. 

Wait, but the tool's answer also mentioned "dosage" and "preparation". So structuring the answer with bullet points or numbered steps would make it clearer. However, in the actual response, the assistant needs to present this in a conversational tone. Also, since the tool's answer is from a search, maybe there's more info or considerations the assistant can infer, like storage, but the provided tool response didn't include that.

Check for any possible issues: The assistant must ensure that they are not providing illegal advice. Since the tool's response already mentions checking local laws, that's covered. Also, the assistant should frame the answer in a way that's informative but doesn't endorse illegal activity, just presents the info as factual, with the caveat of consulting local laws.

Potential structure:

1. First, check the legality in your area. This is crucial because possession can lead to legal issues.
2. Start with a low dose (as per the tool's 1-2g dried equivalent in fresh).
3. Preparation tips: using citrus or chocolate to reduce bitterness. Maybe suggest methods like crushing, mixing with other ingredients, or consuming with food.
4. Mention that fresh mushrooms have lower concentration, so higher quantity is needed.
5. Additional safety considerations: experienced user, trusted source, etc.

Wait, the tool's response didn't explicitly mention how to handle freshness, so maybe the assistant should clarify that the dosage in fresh mushrooms requires a higher weight. Alternatively, since the tool's info is about dried, maybe the assistant should add that adjustment, perhaps with a note that fresh mushrooms may need 10x the weight, but to consult reliable sources for exact dosages. 

Alternatively, the assistant can state: "Note that fresh mushrooms have higher water content, so you may need to use more by weight than the dried dosage. For accuracy, many people dry the mushrooms first."

But since the tool's response didn't specify, the assistant should stick to the given info and perhaps mention that when consuming fresh, the dosage is different, but the tool's recommendation is for dried, so they should adjust accordingly. 

Also, maybe preparation steps like drying them, cooking, etc., but perhaps that's beyond the tool's answer? The tool's response didn't cover preparation methods other than using citrus/chocolate. 

Putting it all together, the answer should be concise, clear, and structured for readability, ensuring the legal aspect is first and foremost, followed by dosage and preparation tips.

Here‚Äôs how to consume freshly harvested magic mushrooms, based on current information and safety considerations:

---

### 1. **Check Legal Status First**
   - **Legality**: Magic mushrooms (psilocybin) are illegal in most countries and U.S. states. Before proceeding, confirm the legal status in your location to avoid legal consequences.

---

### 2. **Dosage Guidelines**  
   - **Starting Dose (Dried)**: Typically 1‚Äì2 grams dried.  
   - **Fresh Mushrooms**:  
     - Fresh mushrooms are ~90% water, so their potency is diluted. A fresh dose may require **10‚Äì20+ grams** to match a 1‚Äì2g dried dose.  
     - *Caution*: Overconsumption can lead to unexpected effects due to miscalculations.

---

### 3. **Preparation & Consumption**  
   - **Masking Bitterness**:  
     - Squeeze lemon or lime juice over them.  
     - Mix with dark chocolate, honey, or in a smoothie to reduce bitterness.  
   - **Options for Consumption**:  
     - Eat directly (recommended after proper drying/processing).  
     - Dry them first (spread on a tray and let sit for days or use a dehydrator) for more precise dosing.  
     - Cook them but note that heat may reduce potency slightly.  

---

### 4. **Safety & Mindfulness**  
   - Start with a low dose in a safe environment (e.g., at home).  
   - Avoid driving or operating machinery.  
   - Consider having an experienced person present if possible.  

---

### 5. **Important Notes**  
   - **Legal Risks**: Prioritize understanding local laws‚Äîthis information does not endorse breaking them.  
   - **Quality Assurance**: Only consume mushrooms you‚Äôre 100% certain are correctly identified to avoid toxic look-alikes.
